# About  

Moataz Alghamdi earned a PhD in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences from King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the supervision of Prof. Daniele Boffi. He also holds a BSc in Physics from the University of Washington, Seattle. His work sits at the intersection of mathematics, scientific computing, and machine learning, aimed at building tools that make complex systems tractable, high-performance, and transparent.

Dr. Alghamdi studies high-dimensional and uncertain systems, developing mathematical and computational techniques that replace expensive full models with efficient surrogate representations. By combining adaptive sampling, probabilistic modeling, and low-rank/low-complexity approximations, he enables analyses that would otherwise be computationally prohibitiveâ€”supporting exploration of design spaces, rigorous uncertainty quantification, and long-horizon decision making across engineering, scientific computing, finance, and economics.

Looking forward, his aim is to translate advanced mathematical theory into auditable, practical systems with sustained impact across disciplines.


# Research Outline  
## Principal Interests  


### 1. Probabilistic Modeling and Machine Learning
Probabilistic modeling and kernel methods for uncertainty-aware prediction and inference. Gaussian-process priors on function spaces (viewed through the reproducing-kernel Hilbert space lens) treat the kernel as the unifying object linking GPs, graphical/state-space models, and wide-network/linearized neural predictors. Emphasis on scalable inference via sparse/Markov and state-space representations, with attention to calibration, robustness to distribution shift, and interpretability.

### 2. Decision Making in Finance and Economics
Sequential decision making under uncertainty grounded in dynamic programming, stochastic control, and robust optimization, with emphasis on value functions, policy approximation, and risk-sensitive objectives. Probabilistic uncertainty quantification informs policies for investment, forecasting, and resource allocation, with explicit attention to constraints, transparency and the ability to satisfy domain requirements such as Sharia-compliant finance.

### 3. Data Compression with Tensor Trains

Low-rank approximation is pursued via the tensor-train (TT) decomposition technique. The focus is on rank-adaptive TT factorizations with perturbation-stable cores and explicit error/complexity control (cost scaling essentially linearly in dimension for bounded ranks). These TT surrogates compress discretized PDE operators and GP covariances, enabling scalable simulation, inference, and uncertainty quantification, and integrate naturally with kernel and probabilistic models.

### 4. Simplifying Complex Mathematical Models
Focus on parametric PDEs with high-dimensional parameter spaces, formulated at the level of the solution operator and associated spectral maps. Develop certified reduced models that balance fidelity and cost via parameter-aware adaptive sampling and rigorous a posteriori control, while treating spectral structure (eigenvalue branches and eigenspaces) as a primary output for stable mode tracking and provable complexity/accuracy guarantees.
